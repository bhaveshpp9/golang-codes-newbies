\\ Reflection â€” get type members

In Go, reflection can be used to inspect the type members of a struct, such as fields and methods. The `reflect` package provides the necessary tools to get detailed information about the type, its fields, and its methods.

### Key Concepts in Reflection

1. **Type and Value**: The `reflect` package provides two main types: `Type` and `Value`. `Type` represents the type of a variable, and `Value` represents the value of a variable.
2. **StructField**: Contains information about a single field of a struct.
3. **Method**: Contains information about a single method of a type.

### Example: Inspecting Type Members

Let's create an example where we define a struct with some fields and methods, and then use reflection to inspect its members.

#### Defining the Struct

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "reflect"
)

type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

func (p Person) Greet() {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, my name is %s.\n", p.Name)
}

func (p Person) GetAge() int {
    return p.Age
}
```

#### Using Reflection to Inspect Type Members

```go
package main

func main() {
    // Create an instance of Person
    person := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}

    // Get the reflection Type object
    personType := reflect.TypeOf(person)

    // Get and print the struct fields
    fmt.Println("Fields:")
    for i := 0; i < personType.NumField(); i++ {
        field := personType.Field(i)
        fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Type: %s, Tag: %s\n", field.Name, field.Type, field.Tag)
    }

    // Get and print the struct methods
    fmt.Println("\nMethods:")
    for i := 0; i < personType.NumMethod(); i++ {
        method := personType.Method(i)
        fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Type: %s\n", method.Name, method.Type)
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Creating an Instance**: We create an instance of `Person`.
2. **Getting Reflection Type Object**: We use `reflect.TypeOf(person)` to get the reflection `Type` object for the instance.
3. **Getting Struct Fields**:
   - `NumField()` returns the number of fields in the struct.
   - `Field(i)` returns the `i`-th field of the struct as a `StructField` object.
   - We print the field's name, type, and tag.
4. **Getting Struct Methods**:
   - `NumMethod()` returns the number of methods in the struct.
   - `Method(i)` returns the `i`-th method of the struct as a `Method` object.
   - We print the method's name and type.

### Detailed Output

The output of the above code will be:
```
Fields:
Name: Name, Type: string, Tag: 
Name: Age, Type: int, Tag: 

Methods:
Name: GetAge, Type: func(main.Person) int
Name: Greet, Type: func(main.Person)
```

### Notes on Reflection

- **Field Information**: The `StructField` object provides detailed information about a struct field, including its name, type, and tag.
- **Method Information**: The `Method` object provides detailed information about a method, including its name and type.
- **Method Ordering**: The methods are sorted lexicographically by method name.

By using reflection to inspect type members, you can dynamically explore the structure of types at runtime. This is particularly useful for tasks such as serialization, deserialization, and building generic frameworks.
