\\ Lambda Expressions â€”  with multiple operators

Lambda expressions in Go, also known as anonymous functions, can be composed to perform complex operations by combining multiple operators and logic within a single function. Let's explore some examples that demonstrate how to use lambda expressions with multiple operators.

### Example: Combining Multiple Operators in a Lambda Expression

Here's an example that performs a series of arithmetic operations using an anonymous function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Define an anonymous function that combines multiple operators
    calculate := func(a, b int) int {
        return (a + b) * (a - b)
    }

    // Use the anonymous function
    result := calculate(10, 5)

    fmt.Println(result) // Output: 75
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Anonymous Function:** Define the `calculate` anonymous function that takes two integers `a` and `b`, and performs a combination of addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
2. **Function Call:** Call the `calculate` function with the arguments `10` and `5`, and print the result.

### Practical Example: Complex Conditional Logic

Let's create a more practical example where an anonymous function is used to perform complex conditional logic:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Define an anonymous function with multiple operators and conditional logic
    evaluate := func(a, b int) string {
        if a > b {
            return fmt.Sprintf("%d is greater than %d", a, b)
        } else if a < b {
            return fmt.Sprintf("%d is less than %d", a, b)
        } else {
            return fmt.Sprintf("%d is equal to %d", a, b)
        }
    }

    // Use the anonymous function
    result1 := evaluate(10, 5)
    result2 := evaluate(5, 10)
    result3 := evaluate(7, 7)

    fmt.Println(result1) // Output: 10 is greater than 5
    fmt.Println(result2) // Output: 5 is less than 10
    fmt.Println(result3) // Output: 7 is equal to 7
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Anonymous Function:** Define the `evaluate` anonymous function that takes two integers `a` and `b`, and uses multiple conditional operators to return a string describing their relationship.
2. **Function Calls:** Call the `evaluate` function with different pairs of arguments and print the results.

### Example: Higher-Order Function with Multiple Operators

You can also use higher-order functions to pass lambda expressions that perform multiple operations:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Higher-order function that takes two integers and a function
func compute(a, b int, operation func(int, int) int) int {
    return operation(a, b)
}

func main() {
    // Define multiple operations using anonymous functions
    add := func(a, b int) int {
        return a + b
    }

    subtract := func(a, b int) int {
        return a - b
    }

    multiply := func(a, b int) int {
        return a * b
    }

    // Use the higher-order function with different operations
    result1 := compute(10, 5, add)
    result2 := compute(10, 5, subtract)
    result3 := compute(10, 5, multiply)

    fmt.Println(result1) // Output: 15
    fmt.Println(result2) // Output: 5
    fmt.Println(result3) // Output: 50
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Higher-Order Function:** Define the `compute` function that takes two integers and a function `operation` that performs an operation on the integers.
2. **Anonymous Functions:** Define anonymous functions `add`, `subtract`, and `multiply` that perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, respectively.
3. **Function Calls:** Use the `compute` function with different operations and print the results.

### Example: Lambda Expression with Logical Operators

Here's an example using logical operators within a lambda expression:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Define an anonymous function that uses logical operators
    logicalCheck := func(a, b int) bool {
        return a > 0 && b > 0 || a == 0
    }

    // Use the anonymous function
    result1 := logicalCheck(10, 5)
    result2 := logicalCheck(-5, 5)
    result3 := logicalCheck(0, 5)

    fmt.Println(result1) // Output: true
    fmt.Println(result2) // Output: false
    fmt.Println(result3) // Output: true
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Anonymous Function:** Define the `logicalCheck` anonymous function that takes two integers `a` and `b`, and uses logical operators to return a boolean result.
2. **Function Calls:** Call the `logicalCheck` function with different pairs of arguments and print the results.

### Summary

- **Lambda Expressions with Multiple Operators:** In Go, anonymous functions can be used to combine multiple operators and perform complex logic.
- **Arithmetic and Logical Operations:** Use anonymous functions to encapsulate arithmetic, conditional, and logical operations.
- **Higher-Order Functions:** Pass anonymous functions as parameters to higher-order functions to create flexible and reusable code.

By leveraging lambda expressions with multiple operators, you can write concise and expressive code in Go, encapsulating complex logic within functions that can be easily passed around and reused.
