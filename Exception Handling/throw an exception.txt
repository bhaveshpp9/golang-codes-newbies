\\ Exceptions Handling â€” throw an exception

In Go, traditional exception handling mechanisms (like those found in Java or Python) do not exist. Instead, Go uses a combination of error values and panic/recover for error and exception handling. "Throwing an exception" in Go is typically done using the `panic` function.

### Throwing an Exception using `panic`

The `panic` function in Go can be used to stop the normal flow of control and begin unwinding the stack. It's a way to signal that something unexpected has happened and the program cannot continue. 

Here's how you can "throw an exception" using `panic`:

### Example: Simple `panic`

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Starting the program")

	// Trigger a panic
	throwException("Something went wrong!")

	fmt.Println("This will not be printed")
}

func throwException(message string) {
	panic(message)
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Triggering Panic:**
   ```go
   panic(message)
   ```
   The `panic` function takes an argument of any type, often a string, which describes the error or exceptional condition.

2. **Unwinding the Stack:**
   When `panic` is called, the program prints the panic message and starts to unwind the stack, executing any deferred functions along the way, and eventually terminating the program if not recovered.

### Handling Panics with `recover`

To handle panics and potentially allow the program to continue running, you can use the `recover` function inside a deferred function. This allows you to catch the panic, handle it, and prevent the program from crashing.

### Example: Handling a Panic

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	defer func() {
		if err := recover(); err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", err)
		}
	}()

	fmt.Println("Starting the program")

	// Trigger a panic
	throwException("Something went wrong!")

	fmt.Println("This will not be printed")
}

func throwException(message string) {
	panic(message)
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Deferred Recovery Function:**
   ```go
   defer func() {
       if err := recover(); err != nil {
           fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", err)
       }
   }()
   ```
   This deferred function calls `recover` to catch any panic that occurs in the `main` function. If a panic is caught, it prints the panic message and the program can continue running if desired.

2. **Panic and Recovery:**
   The `panic` is triggered in `throwException` and caught by the deferred function in `main`. This demonstrates how you can "throw" and "catch" exceptions in Go using `panic` and `recover`.

### Practical Use Case: Error Handling in a Web Server

In a web server context, you might use `panic` and `recover` to handle unexpected errors gracefully without crashing the server:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", safeHandler)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

func safeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	defer func() {
		if err := recover(); err != nil {
			http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Internal Server Error: %v", err), http.StatusInternalServerError)
		}
	}()

	// Simulate an unexpected error
	throwException("A critical error occurred")

	fmt.Fprintln(w, "This will not be printed if panic occurs")
}

func throwException(message string) {
	panic(message)
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Deferred Recovery in HTTP Handler:**
   ```go
   defer func() {
       if err := recover(); err != nil {
           http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Internal Server Error: %v", err), http.StatusInternalServerError)
       }
   }()
   ```
   This deferred function catches any panic that occurs within the HTTP handler function `safeHandler`, logs the error, and responds with a 500 Internal Server Error.

2. **Simulated Panic:**
   ```go
   throwException("A critical error occurred")
   ```
   This line simulates an unexpected error by calling `throwException`, which triggers a panic.

### Conclusion

In Go, "throwing an exception" is achieved using the `panic` function. While this is different from traditional exception handling mechanisms in other languages, it serves a similar purpose for signaling and handling unexpected conditions. Proper use of `panic` and `recover` allows you to manage exceptional situations effectively without compromising the stability and readability of your code.
