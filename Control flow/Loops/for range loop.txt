\\ Control flow â€” Loops â€” "for range" loop

Certainly! The `for range` loop in Go is particularly useful for iterating over elements of slices, arrays, maps, and strings. It gives you a simple syntax to access each element in these collections. Letâ€™s look at an example using a slice of integers to calculate the total sum of its elements, showcasing the elegance and simplicity of the `for range` loop.

### Scenario
We want to sum up all the numbers in a slice. This example helps illustrate the use of the `for range` loop to iterate over a slice and perform an operation on each element.

### Go Code Example
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Define a slice of integers
    numbers := []int{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

    // Variable to hold the sum of the numbers
    total := 0

    // Iterate over the slice using a for range loop
    for _, number := range numbers {
        total += number // Add each number to total
    }

    // Print the total sum
    fmt.Printf("The total sum of numbers is: %d\n", total)
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Slice of Integers**: We define a `numbers` slice that contains five integers.
2. **Initialization of Total**: Before the loop starts, we initialize a variable `total` to zero. This will hold the sum of all the numbers.
3. **For Range Loop**: The `for range` loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` slice.
   - **_ (underscore)**: This is used to ignore the index that the `range` expression also returns because it's not needed in this operation.
   - **number**: This is the variable that stores the value of the current element in the slice during each iteration.
4. **Sum Calculation**: Inside the loop, we add the value of `number` to `total`.
5. **Output**: After the loop, we print the total sum of all the numbers in the slice.

This code effectively demonstrates how the `for range` loop makes it straightforward to process elements in a collection without manually handling the indices or the mechanics of the loop iteration. This loop structure is ideal for any operation where you need to access every element in a collection, whether for computation, transformation, or evaluation.
