\\ Control flow â€” Loops â€” "until" loop


Like with the `while` loop, Go does not have an explicit `until` loop construct. In other languages, an `until` loop continues execution until a certain condition becomes true. In Go, you can emulate this behavior using a `for` loop with a negated condition, effectively mirroring the functionality of an `until` loop.

### Scenario
Let's say we want to simulate a scenario where a countdown continues until it reaches zero. This is a straightforward example where you would typically use an `until` loop in other languages.

### Go Code Example
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Start the countdown at 10
    countdown := 10

    // Simulate 'until' loop using a 'for' loop
    for countdown > 0 {
        fmt.Println(countdown)
        countdown--
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Pause for a second between counts
    }
    fmt.Println("Liftoff!")
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We start with the `countdown` variable set to 10.
2. **For Loop**: The loop is set up with the condition `countdown > 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as the countdown is greater than 0, effectively emulating `until countdown equals 0`.
3. **Countdown Operation**: Inside the loop, we print the current value of `countdown`, then decrement it by 1, and pause for one second using `time.Sleep` to create a real-time countdown effect.
4. **Completion**: Once the loop exits (when `countdown` reaches 0), we print "Liftoff!"

This approach shows how you can use Go's `for` loop to mimic the behavior of an `until` loop, executing a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met. Go's single looping construct (`for`) is versatile enough to handle various looping requirements with simplicity and clarity.
