\\ Control flow â€”   Pipeline â€” Chennels


Channels in Go are a fundamental part of its concurrency model, used to synchronize and communicate between goroutines. They provide a way for goroutines to send and receive values, effectively enabling safe data exchange without the need for explicit locks or condition variables. Channels can be thought of as pipes that connect concurrent goroutines, through which you can pass typed data.

### Scenario
Let's illustrate the use of channels by creating a simple example where one goroutine generates numbers and sends them to another goroutine through a channel for processing (e.g., to calculate the square of each number).

### Go Code Example
Here's an example that demonstrates how to use channels to set up a basic pipeline between two goroutines:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// Create a channel for communicating integers
	numberChannel := make(chan int)

	// Goroutine to generate numbers
	go func() {
		for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
			fmt.Printf("Generated number: %d\n", i)
			numberChannel <- i // Send number to the channel
			time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Simulate some delay
		}
		close(numberChannel) // Close the channel after sending all numbers
	}()

	// Goroutine to receive numbers and process them
	go func() {
		// Receive numbers until the channel is closed
		for number := range numberChannel {
			square := number * number
			fmt.Printf("Processed square: %d\n", square)
		}
	}()

	// Wait for a moment to ensure all processing is done
	time.Sleep(6 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("All numbers processed.")
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Channel Creation**: We start by creating a channel `numberChannel` that transmits integers. This channel serves as the communication link between the goroutines.
   
2. **Number Generator Goroutine**: This goroutine runs a loop to generate numbers from 1 to 5. Each number is sent to `numberChannel` using `numberChannel <- i`. After generating all numbers, the goroutine closes the channel with `close(numberChannel)`, indicating there are no more numbers to send.

3. **Processing Goroutine**: This goroutine continuously receives numbers from the channel using a `for` loop with the `range` keyword, which reads values from the channel until it is closed. For each number received, it calculates the square and prints it.

4. **Main Function Sleep**: In the main function, a `time.Sleep` is used to keep the program running long enough for all numbers to be processed and displayed. This is a simple synchronization method to ensure the main function doesn't terminate prematurely.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the generated numbers and their processed squares, demonstrating a simple but effective use of channels for goroutine communication and synchronization.

This example provides a basic understanding of how to use channels to facilitate communication between goroutines, allowing for effective and safe data handling in concurrent Go applications. If you have more questions about channels, goroutines, or concurrency in Go, feel free to ask! ðŸ”¨ðŸ¤–ðŸ”§
