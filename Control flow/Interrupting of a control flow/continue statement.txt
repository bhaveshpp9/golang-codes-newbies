\\ Control flow â€” Interrupting of a control flow â€” "continue" statement


Absolutely! The `continue` statement in Go is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. This is particularly useful when you want to skip certain conditions within a loop but continue processing other items. Letâ€™s look at a practical example to illustrate its use.

### Scenario
Imagine we're processing a list of numbers. We want to print the numbers only if they are even. If a number is odd, we'll skip printing it using the `continue` statement.

### Go Code Example
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Define a slice of numbers
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

    // Iterate through the numbers
    for _, number := range numbers {
        if number%2 != 0 {
            continue // Skip the current iteration if the number is odd
        }
        fmt.Println(number) // This line only executes for even numbers
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **List of Numbers**: We have a list (slice) of numbers ranging from 1 to 10.
2. **Loop and Condition**: As we iterate through the numbers, we check each number to see if it's odd (`number % 2 != 0`). If it is, the `continue` statement is executed.
3. **Continue Statement**: When `continue` is encountered, the loop immediately skips the remaining part of the current iteration (in this case, skipping the `fmt.Println(number)` statement) and jumps to the next iteration of the loop.
4. **Output**: The loop thus only prints even numbers, effectively filtering out odd numbers from being printed.

This example shows how `continue` can be used to control which iterations of a loop should complete and which should be skipped based on a specific condition. Itâ€™s a powerful tool for managing flow in loops, making your code cleaner and often more efficient. Need any more details or another example? Let me know! ðŸ”¨ðŸ¤–ðŸ”§
