\\ Control flow â€” Interrupting of a control flow â€” labeled statement


Certainly! In Go, you can use labeled statements in conjunction with `break` or `continue` to manage control flow in complex nested loops or switch cases. This feature is particularly useful when you want to exit from multiple nested loops at once or to skip to the next iteration of an outer loop.

### Scenario
Imagine we have a matrix (2D slice in Go) and we want to search for a specific value. If we find this value, we want to exit from all loops immediately. We'll use a labeled statement to control the flow efficiently.

### Go Code Example
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Define a 2D slice, simulating a matrix
    matrix := [][]int{
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
        {7, 8, 9},
        {10, 11, 12},
    }

    // The value we are searching for
    searchValue := 9
    found := false

    // Labeled outer loop for easy exit from nested loops
    OuterLoop:
    for row, rowValues := range matrix {
        for col, value := range rowValues {
            if value == searchValue {
                fmt.Printf("Found %d at (%d, %d)\n", value, row, col)
                found = true
                break OuterLoop
            }
        }
    }

    if !found {
        fmt.Println("Value not found in the matrix.")
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Matrix and Search Setup**: We define a `matrix` as a 2D slice and set a `searchValue` that we want to find within this matrix.
2. **Labeled Outer Loop**: We label the outer loop as `OuterLoop`. This label is then used with the `break` statement inside the inner loop. When `break OuterLoop` is executed, it terminates the outer loop immediately, not just the innermost loop.
3. **Finding the Value**: As we iterate through the matrix, if we find the search value, we print its position and use `break OuterLoop` to exit all loops at once.

This technique is valuable in situations where deeper nested control flows are involved, and you need precise control over where the loop exits. It avoids the complexity and potential errors of setting multiple flags or conditions to manage loop exits. This labeled break provides a clean, understandable way to handle such scenarios in Go.
