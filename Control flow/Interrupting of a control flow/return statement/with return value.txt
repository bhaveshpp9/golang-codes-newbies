\\ Control flow â€” Interrupting of a control flow â€” "return" statement â€” with return value


Absolutely! The `return` statement in Go not only terminates the function but can also send back one or more values to the caller. This is particularly useful for controlling flow within a function based on specific conditions, allowing you to return different values under different circumstances.

### Scenario
Let's set up a function to evaluate whether a given password meets certain security criteria and return a boolean value indicating the result.

### Go Code Example
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// validatePassword checks if the password meets the required security standards
func validatePassword(password string) (bool, string) {
    // Check password length
    if len(password) < 8 {
        return false, "Password is too short; must be at least 8 characters."
    }

    // Check for numeric characters
    hasNumber := false
    for _, char := range password {
        if char >= '0' && char <= '9' {
            hasNumber = true
            break
        }
    }
    if !hasNumber {
        return false, "Password must include at least one numeric character."
    }

    // If all checks pass
    return true, "Password is valid."
}

func main() {
    // Example passwords to validate
    passwords := []string{"hello", "welcome123", "golang"}

    // Process each password
    for _, password := range passwords {
        valid, message := validatePassword(password)
        fmt.Printf("Password: %s - Valid: %t - Message: %s\n", password, valid, message)
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **validatePassword Function**: This function evaluates a password and returns two values: a `bool` indicating if the password is valid, and a `string` providing a message about the password's validity.
    - **Length Check**: First, it checks if the password length is less than 8 characters. If so, it returns `false` along with a message stating the password is too short.
    - **Numeric Character Check**: It then checks for the presence of at least one numeric character. If no numeric characters are found, it returns `false` with an appropriate message.
    - **Valid Password**: If the password passes all checks, it returns `true` with a validation message.
2. **Main Function**: In the main function, various example passwords are processed to show how the validation works in practice.

This approach using `return` statements allows for early exit from the function with meaningful feedback depending on the outcome of each check, making it very efficient for condition-based processing and decision-making.
