\\ Control flow â€” Conditional Statements â€” if/else statements -- Valid Example 2


Great! Letâ€™s explore another practical use of `if/else` statements in Go. This time, we'll focus on a scenario involving financial transactions, specifically calculating transaction fees based on the amount being transferred.

### Scenario
We want to implement a function that applies different transaction fees based on the amount being transferred:
- **No fee:** For transactions up to $100.
- **Low fee:** A fee of 1% for transactions over $100 and up to $1000.
- **High fee:** A fee of 2% for transactions over $1000.

### Go Code Example
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// function to calculate transaction fee based on the amount
func calculateFee(amount float64) float64 {
    switch {
    case amount <= 100:
        return 0 // no fee for transactions up to $100
    case amount <= 1000:
        return amount * 0.01 // 1% fee for transactions over $100 up to $1000
    default:
        return amount * 0.02 // 2% fee for transactions over $1000
    }
}

func main() {
    // Example transaction amounts
    transactions := []float64{50, 150, 2000}

    // Calculating and printing the fees for each transaction
    for _, amount := range transactions {
        fee := calculateFee(amount)
        fmt.Printf("Transaction amount: $%.2f - Fee: $%.2f\n", amount, fee)
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **calculateFee Function**: This function uses a `switch` statement, which is a form of conditional control similar to `if/else` but often cleaner when dealing with multiple distinct cases. It determines the appropriate fee percentage based on the transaction amount.
2. **Main Function**: We test the fee calculation function with three different transaction amounts, each designed to fall into one of the fee brackets.

This example clearly illustrates how to use conditional logic to implement a tiered fee structure. It effectively demonstrates decision-making based on financial criteria, which is a common requirement in financial applications. Ready to dive deeper into any specific aspects or need more examples?
