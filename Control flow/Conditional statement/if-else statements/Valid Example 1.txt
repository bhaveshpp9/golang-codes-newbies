\\ Control flow â€” Conditional Statements â€” if/else statements -- Valid Example 1


Absolutely! Let's craft another example using `if/else` statements in Go, focusing on a scenario where we want to classify temperatures as "cold," "moderate," or "hot" based on the temperature reading.

### Scenario
We're building a system that reads temperature data from a sensor and categorizes the temperature. The categorization is as follows:
- **Cold:** Temperature less than 10 degrees Celsius.
- **Moderate:** Temperature between 10 and 25 degrees Celsius.
- **Hot:** Temperature greater than 25 degrees Celsius.

### Go Code Example
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// function to categorize temperature
func categorizeTemperature(temp float64) string {
    if temp < 10 {
        return "Cold"
    } else if temp >= 10 && temp <= 25 {
        return "Moderate"
    } else {
        return "Hot"
    }
}

func main() {
    // Example temperature readings
    temperatures := []float64{-5, 12, 23, 30}

    // Categorizing and printing the results for each temperature
    for _, temperature := range temperatures {
        category := categorizeTemperature(temperature)
        fmt.Printf("Temperature %.1fÂ°C is %s.\n", temperature, category)
    }
}

```

### Explanation
1. **categorizeTemperature Function**: This function takes a temperature reading (`temp`) and returns a string indicating its category. It uses `if-else` statements to determine which category the temperature falls into based on the defined ranges.
2. **Main Function**: We simulate a few temperature readings to demonstrate how the categorization function works in practice. The function is tested with temperatures that should fall into each of the defined categories.

This simple but effective example clearly demonstrates how to use `if/else` statements for decision-making based on numeric ranges. This approach is common in applications where input data must be classified into various categories based on thresholds or criteria. Ready to heat things up or cool them down with more Go code?
