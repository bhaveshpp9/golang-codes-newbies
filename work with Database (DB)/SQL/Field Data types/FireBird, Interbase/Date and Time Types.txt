\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Field data types — FireBird, Interbase — Date and Time Types


In Firebird and Interbase, date and time data types are used to store and manipulate date and time information. These databases provide several data types for handling date and time values effectively. Here’s a detailed guide on how to work with date and time types in Firebird and Interbase.

### Date and Time Data Types

1. **DATE**: Stores only the date (year, month, and day).
2. **TIME**: Stores only the time (hours, minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds).
3. **TIMESTAMP**: Stores both date and time.

### Creating a Table with Date and Time Fields

To create a table with date and time fields in Firebird or Interbase, you can use the `DATE`, `TIME`, and `TIMESTAMP` data types.

#### Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE Events (
    EventID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    EventName VARCHAR(100),
    EventDate DATE,
    EventTime TIME,
    EventTimestamp TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Inserting Data into Date and Time Fields

You can insert date and time data into the table using appropriate SQL syntax.

```sql
INSERT INTO Events (EventID, EventName, EventDate, EventTime, EventTimestamp)
VALUES (1, 'Conference', '2024-06-15', '09:00:00', '2024-06-15 09:00:00');

INSERT INTO Events (EventID, EventName, EventDate, EventTime, EventTimestamp)
VALUES (2, 'Meeting', '2024-07-01', '14:30:00', '2024-07-01 14:30:00');
```

### Querying Data with Date and Time Fields

You can query date and time fields using various functions and operators.

#### Selecting Records Based on Date

```sql
SELECT * FROM Events
WHERE EventDate = '2024-06-15';
```

#### Selecting Records in a Date Range

```sql
SELECT * FROM Events
WHERE EventDate BETWEEN '2024-06-01' AND '2024-06-30';
```

#### Selecting Records Based on Time

```sql
SELECT * FROM Events
WHERE EventTime = '09:00:00';
```

#### Selecting Records Based on Timestamp

```sql
SELECT * FROM Events
WHERE EventTimestamp >= '2024-06-15 00:00:00' AND EventTimestamp < '2024-06-16 00:00:00';
```

### Updating Date and Time Fields

You can update date and time fields using the `UPDATE` statement.

```sql
UPDATE Events
SET EventDate = '2024-08-01',
    EventTime = '10:00:00',
    EventTimestamp = '2024-08-01 10:00:00'
WHERE EventID = 1;
```

### Deleting Data Based on Date and Time Fields

You can delete records based on date and time conditions.

```sql
DELETE FROM Events
WHERE EventDate < '2024-07-01';
```

### Practical Examples and Use Cases

#### Extracting Parts of Date and Time

You can extract specific parts of date and time using functions like `EXTRACT`.

##### Extracting Year and Month

```sql
SELECT EventID, 
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM EventDate) AS EventYear,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM EventDate) AS EventMonth
FROM Events;
```

##### Extracting Hour and Minute

```sql
SELECT EventID, 
       EXTRACT(HOUR FROM EventTime) AS EventHour,
       EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM EventTime) AS EventMinute
FROM Events;
```

#### Formatting Date and Time

You can format date and time fields using the `CAST` function.

##### Formatting as 'YYYY-MM-DD'

```sql
SELECT EventID, 
       CAST(EventDate AS VARCHAR(10)) AS FormattedDate
FROM Events;
```

#### Adding/Subtracting Time Intervals

You can add or subtract time intervals using the `DATEADD` function.

##### Adding 1 Month to Event Date

```sql
UPDATE Events
SET EventDate = DATEADD(MONTH, 1, EventDate)
WHERE EventID = 1;
```

##### Subtracting 1 Hour from Event Time

```sql
UPDATE Events
SET EventTime = DATEADD(HOUR, -1, EventTime)
WHERE EventID = 1;
```

### Handling NULL Values

Date and time fields can be `NULL` if no value is provided. You can check for `NULL` values using the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` operators.

##### Example: Inserting and Checking for NULL Values

```sql
INSERT INTO Events (EventID, EventName, EventDate, EventTime, EventTimestamp)
VALUES (3, 'Webinar', NULL, NULL, NULL);

SELECT * FROM Events
WHERE EventDate IS NULL;
```

### Using Date and Time Fields in Calculations

You can use date and time fields in calculations to perform complex queries.

##### Example: Calculating Duration Between Two Timestamps

```sql
SELECT EventID, 
       EventName, 
       CAST(EventTimestamp AS TIMESTAMP) - CAST(EventDate AS TIMESTAMP) AS Duration
FROM Events;
```

### Summary

In Firebird and Interbase, date and time fields are managed using the `DATE`, `TIME`, and `TIMESTAMP` data types. You can create tables with date and time fields, insert and query data, update and delete records based on date and time, and perform various date and time calculations and formatting. These operations are essential for managing and analyzing date and time data in Firebird and Interbase.
