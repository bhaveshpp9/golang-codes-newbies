\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Field data types — FireBird, Interbase — Float Types


In Firebird and Interbase, float types are used to store approximate numeric values with floating decimal points. These databases provide several data types for storing floating-point numbers. Here’s a detailed guide on how to work with float types in Firebird and Interbase.

### Float Data Types

1. **FLOAT**: A single-precision floating-point number.
2. **DOUBLE PRECISION**: A double-precision floating-point number.
3. **NUMERIC(p, s)**: Stores exact numeric values with a fixed precision (`p`) and scale (`s`), suitable for cases where precision is important.
4. **DECIMAL(p, s)**: Similar to `NUMERIC`, used for exact numeric values.

### Creating a Table with Float Fields

To create a table with float fields in Firebird or Interbase, you can use the `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`, `NUMERIC`, and `DECIMAL` data types.

#### Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE Measurements (
    MeasurementID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    SensorName VARCHAR(50),
    Temperature FLOAT, -- Single-precision floating-point
    Humidity DOUBLE PRECISION, -- Double-precision floating-point
    Pressure NUMERIC(10, 2), -- Numeric with precision and scale
    Altitude DECIMAL(10, 2) -- Decimal with precision and scale
);
```

### Inserting Data into Float Fields

You can insert floating-point data into the table using appropriate SQL syntax.

```sql
INSERT INTO Measurements (SensorName, Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Altitude)
VALUES ('Sensor1', 23.5, 45.7, 1012.35, 500.50);

INSERT INTO Measurements (SensorName, Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Altitude)
VALUES ('Sensor2', 24.3, 50.1, 1010.25, 520.75);
```

### Querying Data with Float Fields

You can query float fields using various functions and operators.

#### Selecting Records Based on Float Values

```sql
SELECT * FROM Measurements
WHERE Temperature > 24.0;
```

#### Calculating Averages

You can calculate the average value of a float field using the `AVG()` function.

```sql
SELECT AVG(Temperature) AS AvgTemperature,
       AVG(Humidity) AS AvgHumidity,
       AVG(Pressure) AS AvgPressure,
       AVG(Altitude) AS AvgAltitude
FROM Measurements;
```

### Updating Float Fields

You can update float fields using the `UPDATE` statement.

```sql
UPDATE Measurements
SET Temperature = 25.0
WHERE SensorName = 'Sensor1';
```

### Deleting Data Based on Float Fields

You can delete records based on float conditions.

```sql
DELETE FROM Measurements
WHERE Humidity < 50.0;
```

### Practical Examples and Use Cases

#### Calculating Maximum and Minimum Values

You can find the maximum and minimum values of float fields using the `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions.

##### Example: Finding Maximum and Minimum Temperature and Humidity

```sql
SELECT MAX(Temperature) AS MaxTemperature,
       MIN(Temperature) AS MinTemperature,
       MAX(Humidity) AS MaxHumidity,
       MIN(Humidity) AS MinHumidity
FROM Measurements;
```

#### Grouping Data and Calculating Summaries

You can group data by a field and calculate summaries like average, sum, maximum, and minimum values.

##### Example: Grouping by Sensor and Calculating Averages

```sql
SELECT SensorName, 
       AVG(Temperature) AS AvgTemperature,
       AVG(Humidity) AS AvgHumidity,
       AVG(Pressure) AS AvgPressure,
       AVG(Altitude) AS AvgAltitude
FROM Measurements
GROUP BY SensorName;
```

### Handling Precision and Rounding

Floating-point numbers can have precision issues. You can use functions like `ROUND()` to manage precision and rounding.

##### Example: Rounding Float Values

```sql
SELECT SensorName, 
       ROUND(Temperature, 2) AS RoundedTemperature,
       ROUND(Humidity, 1) AS RoundedHumidity
FROM Measurements;
```

### Using Float Fields in Calculations

You can use float fields in mathematical calculations to perform complex queries.

##### Example: Calculating Heat Index

The heat index can be calculated using temperature and humidity values.

```sql
SELECT SensorName, 
       Temperature, 
       Humidity, 
       0.5 * (Temperature + 61.0 + ((Temperature-68.0)*1.2) + (Humidity*0.094)) AS HeatIndex
FROM Measurements;
```

### Handling NULL Values

Float fields can be `NULL` if no value is provided. You can check for `NULL` values using the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` operators.

##### Example: Inserting and Checking for NULL Values

```sql
INSERT INTO Measurements (SensorName, Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Altitude)
VALUES ('Sensor3', NULL, 55.2, 1015.10, NULL);

SELECT * FROM Measurements
WHERE Temperature IS NULL;
```

### Using Float Fields in Complex Queries

You can use float fields in complex queries to perform advanced data analysis.

##### Example: Calculating the Difference Between Two Float Fields

```sql
SELECT SensorName, 
       Temperature, 
       Humidity, 
       (Humidity - Temperature) AS HumidityTemperatureDifference
FROM Measurements;
```

### Summary

In Firebird and Interbase, float types are managed using the `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`, `NUMERIC`, and `DECIMAL` data types. You can create tables with float fields, insert and query data, update and delete records based on float values, and perform various calculations and summaries using aggregate functions. These operations are essential for managing and analyzing numeric data with decimal precision in Firebird and Interbase.
