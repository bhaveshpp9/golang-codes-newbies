\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Field data types — MS SQL Server — Boolean Types

In Microsoft SQL Server, there is no direct `BOOLEAN` data type like in some other SQL databases. Instead, SQL Server uses the `BIT` data type to store Boolean values. The `BIT` data type can store 0, 1, or NULL, where 0 represents `FALSE`, and 1 represents `TRUE`.

Here’s a detailed guide on how to work with Boolean types using the `BIT` data type in Microsoft SQL Server.

### Creating a Table with Boolean Fields

To create a table with Boolean fields in SQL Server, you use the `BIT` data type.

#### Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName NVARCHAR(50),
    LastName NVARCHAR(50),
    IsActive BIT
);
```

### Inserting Data into Boolean Fields

You can insert data into the `BIT` field using 0 and 1 to represent `FALSE` and `TRUE`, respectively.

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, IsActive)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 1);  -- 1 for TRUE

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, IsActive)
VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 0);  -- 0 for FALSE
```

### Querying Data with Boolean Fields

You can query data based on the `BIT` field.

#### Selecting Active Employees

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 1;  -- TRUE
```

#### Selecting Inactive Employees

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 0;  -- FALSE
```

### Updating Boolean Fields

You can update the `BIT` fields using the `UPDATE` statement.

```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET IsActive = 1
WHERE EmployeeID = 2;  -- Set IsActive to TRUE
```

### Deleting Data Based on Boolean Fields

You can delete records based on the `BIT` field.

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 0;  -- Delete Inactive Employees
```

### Practical Examples and Use Cases

#### Counting Active and Inactive Employees

You can count the number of active and inactive employees using aggregate functions.

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN IsActive = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ActiveEmployees,
    SUM(CASE WHEN IsActive = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS InactiveEmployees
FROM Employees;
```

#### Setting Default Values for Boolean Fields

You can set default values for the `BIT` fields during table creation.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName NVARCHAR(50),
    LastName NVARCHAR(50),
    IsActive BIT DEFAULT 1  -- Default to TRUE
);
```

### Handling NULL Values

The `BIT` field can be `NULL` if no value is provided. You can check for `NULL` values using the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` operators.

##### Example: Inserting and Checking for NULL Values

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, IsActive)
VALUES (3, 'Emily', 'Johnson', NULL);  -- NULL value for IsActive

SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive IS NULL;  -- Select employees where IsActive is NULL
```

### Using Boolean Fields in Complex Queries

You can use Boolean fields in complex queries to perform advanced data analysis.

##### Example: Finding Employees Who Are Either Active or Have No Active Status

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE IsActive = 1 OR IsActive IS NULL;
```

### Summary

In Microsoft SQL Server, Boolean types are managed using the `BIT` data type. You can create tables with Boolean fields, insert and query data, update and delete records based on Boolean values, and perform various calculations and summaries using aggregate functions. These operations are essential for managing and analyzing Boolean logic in SQL Server.
