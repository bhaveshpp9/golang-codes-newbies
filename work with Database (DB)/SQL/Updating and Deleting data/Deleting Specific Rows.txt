\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Updating and deleting data — Deleting Specific Rows


Deleting specific rows from a table in SQL involves using the `DELETE` statement along with a `WHERE` clause to specify which rows should be removed. Below are examples of how to delete specific rows from a table in various SQL databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle.

### Example Table

Assume we have the following table named `Employees`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 1, 50000),
(2, 'Bob', 2, 60000),
(3, 'Charlie', 1, 55000),
(4, 'David', 3, 45000),
(5, 'Eva', 2, 70000);
```

### Deleting Specific Rows

#### MySQL

In MySQL, you use the `DELETE` statement with the `WHERE` clause to delete specific rows.

#### Example: Delete Rows Where `dept_id` is 2

```sql
-- Delete rows from the Employees table where dept_id is 2
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE dept_id = 2;
```

#### PostgreSQL

In PostgreSQL, you use the `DELETE` statement with the `WHERE` clause to delete specific rows.

#### Example: Delete Rows Where `salary` is Less Than 50000

```sql
-- Delete rows from the Employees table where salary is less than 50000
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE salary < 50000;
```

#### SQLite

In SQLite, you use the `DELETE` statement with the `WHERE` clause to delete specific rows.

#### Example: Delete Rows Where `emp_name` is 'Alice'

```sql
-- Delete rows from the Employees table where emp_name is 'Alice'
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE emp_name = 'Alice';
```

#### Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL)

In MS SQL Server, you use the `DELETE` statement with the `WHERE` clause to delete specific rows.

#### Example: Delete Rows Where `emp_id` is Greater Than 3

```sql
-- Delete rows from the Employees table where emp_id is greater than 3
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE emp_id > 3;
```

#### Oracle

In Oracle, you use the `DELETE` statement with the `WHERE` clause to delete specific rows.

#### Example: Delete Rows Where `dept_id` is 1

```sql
-- Delete rows from the Employees table where dept_id is 1
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE dept_id = 1;
```

### Practical Examples: Deleting Specific Rows

Here are practical examples of deleting specific rows from the `Employees` table across various SQL databases.

#### MySQL Example

**Delete Rows Where `dept_id` is 2**:

```sql
-- Delete rows from the Employees table where dept_id is 2 in MySQL
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE dept_id = 2;
```

#### PostgreSQL Example

**Delete Rows Where `salary` is Less Than 50000**:

```sql
-- Delete rows from the Employees table where salary is less than 50000 in PostgreSQL
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE salary < 50000;
```

#### SQLite Example

**Delete Rows Where `emp_name` is 'Alice'**:

```sql
-- Delete rows from the Employees table where emp_name is 'Alice' in SQLite
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE emp_name = 'Alice';
```

#### MS SQL Server Example

**Delete Rows Where `emp_id` is Greater Than 3**:

```sql
-- Delete rows from the Employees table where emp_id is greater than 3 in MS SQL Server
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE emp_id > 3;
```

#### Oracle Example

**Delete Rows Where `dept_id` is 1**:

```sql
-- Delete rows from the Employees table where dept_id is 1 in Oracle
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE dept_id = 1;
```

### Considerations

1. **WHERE Clause**: The `WHERE` clause is crucial for deleting specific rows. Omitting the `WHERE` clause will result in all rows being deleted.
2. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to delete rows from the table.
3. **Backup**: Always ensure you have a backup of your data before performing delete operations, especially if they are irreversible.
4. **Transactions**: For databases that support transactions, you can wrap the `DELETE` statement in a transaction to ensure that you can roll back the operation if necessary.

#### Example with Transaction (MS SQL Server)

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Delete rows from the Employees table where emp_id is greater than 3
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE emp_id > 3;

-- Rollback the transaction if needed
-- ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

### Summary

Deleting specific rows from a table involves using the `DELETE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to specify the conditions for deletion. The provided examples demonstrate how to delete specific rows effectively in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL Server, and Oracle.
