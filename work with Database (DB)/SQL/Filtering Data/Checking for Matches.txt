\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Filtering Data — Checking for Matches


In SQL, filtering data by checking for matches involves using various comparison operators, pattern matching, and specific SQL functions to compare values and determine if they meet certain criteria. Below are detailed explanations and examples of different methods for checking for matches in SQL across different database systems.

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. Common comparison operators include `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`.

#### Example

```sql
-- Find all customers whose age is equal to 30
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Age = 30;

-- Find all products whose price is not equal to 100
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price <> 100;

-- Find all employees whose salary is greater than 50000
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 50000;
```

### Pattern Matching with LIKE and Wildcards

The `LIKE` operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column. Wildcards such as `%` (matches zero or more characters) and `_` (matches exactly one character) are used with `LIKE`.

#### Example

```sql
-- Find all customers whose names start with 'Jo'
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'Jo%';

-- Find all products that contain 'phone'
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName LIKE '%phone%';

-- Find all employees whose last names end with 'son'
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE LastName LIKE '%son';

-- Find all products whose names start with 'A' followed by any single character and then 'd'
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName LIKE 'A_d';
```

### IN Operator

The `IN` operator allows you to specify multiple values in a `WHERE` clause.

#### Example

```sql
-- Find all customers who are in the cities 'New York', 'Los Angeles', or 'Chicago'
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City IN ('New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago');

-- Find all products that belong to categories 1, 2, or 3
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE CategoryID IN (1, 2, 3);
```

### BETWEEN Operator

The `BETWEEN` operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

#### Example

```sql
-- Find all employees whose salaries are between 40000 and 60000
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;

-- Find all orders placed between '2024-01-01' and '2024-12-31'
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
```

### EXISTS Operator

The `EXISTS` operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.

#### Example

```sql
-- Find all customers who have placed an order
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Orders
    WHERE Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
);
```

### Combining Conditions with AND and OR

You can combine multiple conditions using the `AND` and `OR` operators to create complex filtering criteria.

#### Example

```sql
-- Find all employees who are in the 'Sales' department and have a salary greater than 50000
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales' AND Salary > 50000;

-- Find all products that are either in category 'Electronics' or have a price less than 100
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Category = 'Electronics' OR Price < 100;
```

### Practical Examples

#### Checking for Exact Matches

```sql
-- Find all orders placed by customer with CustomerID 123
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE CustomerID = 123;
```

#### Checking for Partial Matches

```sql
-- Find all employees whose email addresses contain 'example'
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Email LIKE '%example%';
```

#### Checking for a List of Matches

```sql
-- Find all customers who live in either 'New York' or 'Los Angeles'
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City IN ('New York', 'Los Angeles');
```

#### Checking for a Range of Matches

```sql
-- Find all products with prices between 50 and 150
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 50 AND 150;
```

#### Using Subqueries to Check for Matches

```sql
-- Find all customers who have placed an order with a total amount greater than 1000
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (
    SELECT CustomerID
    FROM Orders
    WHERE TotalAmount > 1000
);
```

### Summary

Filtering data by checking for matches is a fundamental part of SQL queries. You can use comparison operators, pattern matching with `LIKE` and wildcards, the `IN` operator, the `BETWEEN` operator, the `EXISTS` operator, and combine conditions with `AND` and `OR` to create complex and precise filtering criteria.
