\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Filtering Data — Using the AND operator


The `AND` operator in SQL is used to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause, ensuring that all conditions must be true for a row to be included in the result set. It allows for precise and complex data filtering. Below is a detailed guide on how to use the `AND` operator across different SQL databases with practical examples.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND ...;
```

### Examples in Different Databases

#### MySQL

```sql
-- Find all customers who are from 'New York' and have a credit limit greater than 5000
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'New York' AND CreditLimit > 5000;

-- Find all products that are in the 'Electronics' category and have a price less than 100
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Category = 'Electronics' AND Price < 100;
```

#### PostgreSQL

```sql
-- Find all employees who are in the 'HR' department and have a salary greater than 60000
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'HR' AND Salary > 60000;

-- Find all orders that are shipped and have a total amount greater than 1000
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE Status = 'Shipped' AND TotalAmount > 1000;
```

#### Oracle

```sql
-- Find all students who are in grade 'A' and have an attendance greater than 90%
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE Grade = 'A' AND Attendance > 90;

-- Find all books that are published by 'Penguin' and have more than 500 pages
SELECT * FROM Books
WHERE Publisher = 'Penguin' AND Pages > 500;
```

#### SQLite

```sql
-- Find all movies that are rated 'PG' and have a runtime less than 120 minutes
SELECT * FROM Movies
WHERE Rating = 'PG' AND Runtime < 120;

-- Find all articles that are written by 'John Doe' and published after 2020
SELECT * FROM Articles
WHERE Author = 'John Doe' AND PublicationYear > 2020;
```

#### SQL Server

```sql
-- Find all projects that are completed and have a budget greater than 100000
SELECT * FROM Projects
WHERE Status = 'Completed' AND Budget > 100000;

-- Find all employees who are managers and work in the 'IT' department
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE JobTitle = 'Manager' AND Department = 'IT';
```

### Practical Examples and Use Cases

#### Combining Multiple Conditions

You can combine multiple conditions using the `AND` operator to filter data precisely.

```sql
-- Find all employees who are in the 'Sales' department, have a salary greater than 50000, and are not managers
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales' AND Salary > 50000 AND JobTitle <> 'Manager';
```

#### Filtering Numeric Ranges with Additional Conditions

```sql
-- Find all products with prices between 20 and 100 and in the 'Electronics' category
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 20 AND 100 AND Category = 'Electronics';
```

#### Filtering Dates with Additional Conditions

```sql
-- Find all orders placed in the year 2023 that have a total amount greater than 1000
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31' AND TotalAmount > 1000;
```

### Combining AND with Other Operators

You can combine `AND` with other operators like `OR`, `IN`, and `BETWEEN` for more complex queries.

#### Using AND with OR

```sql
-- Find all employees who are in the 'HR' department or 'IT' department and have a salary greater than 60000
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE (Department = 'HR' OR Department = 'IT') AND Salary > 60000;
```

#### Using AND with IN

```sql
-- Find all customers who are from 'New York' or 'Los Angeles' and have a credit limit greater than 5000
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City IN ('New York', 'Los Angeles') AND CreditLimit > 5000;
```

#### Using AND with BETWEEN

```sql
-- Find all projects with budgets between 100000 and 500000 that are completed
SELECT * FROM Projects
WHERE Budget BETWEEN 100000 AND 500000 AND Status = 'Completed';
```

### Handling NULL Values with AND

When using the `AND` operator, ensure that you account for `NULL` values, as comparisons with `NULL` will result in `NULL` (unknown).

#### Example

```sql
-- Find all employees who are in the 'HR' department and have a non-null manager
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'HR' AND ManagerID IS NOT NULL;
```

### Summary

The `AND` operator in SQL is a powerful tool for filtering data based on multiple conditions. It ensures that all specified conditions must be met for a row to be included in the result set. Understanding how to use the `AND` operator effectively allows you to create precise and complex queries to retrieve the exact data you need.

These examples demonstrate how to effectively use the `AND` operator in various scenarios. If you have more specific queries or need further examples, feel free to ask! ✔️
