\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Filtering Data — Checking for No Value


Filtering data to check for no value (i.e., `NULL`) is a common requirement in SQL. `NULL` represents missing or unknown data, and it is different from an empty string or zero. Here’s how you can filter data to check for `NULL` values across different SQL databases.

### Syntax

To check for `NULL` values, use the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
```

### Examples in Different Databases

#### MySQL

```sql
-- Find all customers who do not have an email address
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Email IS NULL;

-- Find all products that have a price
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price IS NOT NULL;
```

#### PostgreSQL

```sql
-- Find all employees who do not have a department assigned
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department IS NULL;

-- Find all orders that have a shipping date
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE ShippingDate IS NOT NULL;
```

#### Oracle

```sql
-- Find all students who do not have a grade assigned
SELECT * FROM Students
WHERE Grade IS NULL;

-- Find all books that have an ISBN number
SELECT * FROM Books
WHERE ISBN IS NOT NULL;
```

#### SQLite

```sql
-- Find all movies that do not have a release date
SELECT * FROM Movies
WHERE ReleaseDate IS NULL;

-- Find all articles that have an author
SELECT * FROM Articles
WHERE Author IS NOT NULL;
```

#### SQL Server

```sql
-- Find all projects that do not have a budget assigned
SELECT * FROM Projects
WHERE Budget IS NULL;

-- Find all employees who have a manager assigned
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE ManagerID IS NOT NULL;
```

### Practical Examples and Use Cases

#### Filtering Records with NULL Values

You can filter records to find rows where a column has no value (is `NULL`).

```sql
-- Find all customers who do not have a phone number
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE PhoneNumber IS NULL;
```

#### Filtering Records without NULL Values

You can filter records to find rows where a column has a value (is not `NULL`).

```sql
-- Find all products that have a description
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Description IS NOT NULL;
```

### Using NULL in Complex Queries

You can use `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` in combination with other conditions using `AND` and `OR`.

#### Example: Combining Conditions

```sql
-- Find all orders that have a total amount greater than 1000 and do not have a shipping date
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE TotalAmount > 1000 AND ShippingDate IS NULL;
```

#### Example: Using OR with NULL

```sql
-- Find all employees who are in the 'HR' department or do not have a department assigned
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'HR' OR Department IS NULL;
```

### Handling NULL with Aggregates

When using aggregate functions, `NULL` values are ignored. However, you can count the number of `NULL` values using the `COUNT` function.

#### Example: Counting NULL Values

```sql
-- Count the number of customers without an email address
SELECT COUNT(*) AS CustomersWithoutEmail
FROM Customers
WHERE Email IS NULL;
```

#### Example: Counting Non-NULL Values

```sql
-- Count the number of products that have a price
SELECT COUNT(Price) AS ProductsWithPrice
FROM Products;
```

### Using COALESCE to Handle NULL

The `COALESCE` function returns the first non-NULL value in a list of arguments. It can be useful for providing default values.

#### Example: Using COALESCE

```sql
-- Select the customer name and their email, or 'No Email' if the email is NULL
SELECT CustomerName, COALESCE(Email, 'No Email') AS Email
FROM Customers;
```

### Summary

Filtering data to check for `NULL` values is essential for handling missing or unknown data in SQL. Using `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` allows you to filter records based on the presence or absence of values. These techniques are supported across all major SQL databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, and SQL Server.

These examples demonstrate how to effectively filter data for `NULL` values in various scenarios. If you have more specific queries or need further examples, feel free to ask! ✔️
