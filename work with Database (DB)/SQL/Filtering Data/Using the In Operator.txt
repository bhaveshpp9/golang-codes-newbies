\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Filtering Data — Using the In Operator


SELECT Code, Name
FROM country
WHERE Code IN ('RUS', 'USA')

Code	Name
RUS	Russian Federation
USA	United States

The SELECT statement retrieves countryes with code 'RUS' and 'USA'. The IN operator is followed by a comma-delimited list of valid values, and the entire list must be enclosed within parentheses. IN operators almost always execute more quickly than lists of OR operators.
