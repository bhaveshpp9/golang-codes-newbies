\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Filtering Data — Using the LIKE operator — [] Wildcard


In SQL, the `LIKE` operator can be used with various wildcards to filter data based on patterns. One of these wildcards is the `[]` wildcard, which allows you to specify a set of characters to match. This wildcard is supported in SQL Server and Sybase but not in other SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or SQLite. 

### Syntax

The basic syntax for using the `LIKE` operator with the `[]` wildcard is:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
```

The `[]` wildcard is used to match any single character within the brackets. You can specify a range of characters (e.g., `[a-z]`) or a specific set of characters (e.g., `[abc]`).

### Examples in SQL Server

#### Matching a Specific Set of Characters

```sql
-- Find all employees whose first names start with 'A', 'B', or 'C'
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE FirstName LIKE '[ABC]%';
```

#### Matching a Range of Characters

```sql
-- Find all employees whose first names start with any letter from 'A' to 'F'
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE FirstName LIKE '[A-F]%';
```

#### Combining Multiple Sets and Ranges

```sql
-- Find all products whose names start with 'X', 'Y', 'Z', or any letter from 'A' to 'C'
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName LIKE '[XYZA-C]%';
```

#### Excluding Characters

You can also use `[^]` to exclude characters within the brackets.

```sql
-- Find all employees whose first names do not start with 'A', 'B', or 'C'
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE FirstName LIKE '[^ABC]%';
```

### Practical Examples and Use Cases

#### Finding Records with Specific Initials

You can use the `[]` wildcard to find records where a column's value starts with specific initials.

```sql
-- Find all customers whose last names start with 'S', 'M', or 'B'
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE LastName LIKE '[SMB]%';
```

#### Finding Records with Character Ranges

You can use the `[]` wildcard to find records where a column's value starts with a character in a specific range.

```sql
-- Find all products whose names start with a letter from 'P' to 'T'
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName LIKE '[P-T]%';
```

#### Finding Records with Mixed Criteria

You can combine different sets and ranges to create more complex patterns.

```sql
-- Find all employees whose first names start with 'D', 'E', 'F', or any digit
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE FirstName LIKE '[DEF0-9]%';
```

### Case Sensitivity

The case sensitivity of the `LIKE` operator with the `[]` wildcard depends on the database's collation settings. In SQL Server, it is typically case-insensitive by default.

### Summary

The `LIKE` operator with the `[]` wildcard is a powerful tool for filtering data based on specific character sets and ranges. It allows for flexible pattern matching in text fields and is particularly useful in SQL Server and Sybase. 

These examples demonstrate how to effectively use the `LIKE` operator with the `[]` wildcard in various scenarios. If you have more specific queries or need further examples, feel free to ask! ✔️
