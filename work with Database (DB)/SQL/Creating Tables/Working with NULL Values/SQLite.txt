CREATE TABLE Documents
(
    doc_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    doc_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    doc_cost REAL
);

Every table column is either a NULL column or a NOT NULL column, and that state is specified in the table definition at creation time. A column that does not allow NULL values does not accept rows with no value—in other words, that column will always be required when rows are inserted or updated.
