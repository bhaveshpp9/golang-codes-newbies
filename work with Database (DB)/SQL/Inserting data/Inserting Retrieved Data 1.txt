\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Inserting data — Inserting Retrieved Data 1


Inserting retrieved data into a SQL table involves using the `INSERT INTO` statement combined with a `SELECT` statement. This approach allows you to copy data from one table to another, or even within the same table, based on specific criteria. Below is a detailed guide on how to insert retrieved data into a table across different SQL databases.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
INSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM source_table
WHERE condition;
```

### Example Table Structure

Assume we have two tables, `Table1` and `Table2`, with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Table1 (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    city VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Table2 (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    city VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### Inserting Retrieved Data

To insert data retrieved from `Table1` into `Table2`, you can use a `SELECT` statement to specify the data to be copied.

### Examples in Different Databases

#### MySQL

```sql
-- Insert data from Table1 into Table2
INSERT INTO Table2 (id, name, age, city)
SELECT id, name, age, city
FROM Table1
WHERE age > 25;
```

#### PostgreSQL

```sql
-- Insert data from Table1 into Table2
INSERT INTO Table2 (id, name, age, city)
SELECT id, name, age, city
FROM Table1
WHERE age > 25;
```

#### Oracle

```sql
-- Insert data from Table1 into Table2
INSERT INTO Table2 (id, name, age, city)
SELECT id, name, age, city
FROM Table1
WHERE age > 25;
```

#### SQLite

```sql
-- Insert data from Table1 into Table2
INSERT INTO Table2 (id, name, age, city)
SELECT id, name, age, city
FROM Table1
WHERE age > 25;
```

#### SQL Server

```sql
-- Insert data from Table1 into Table2
INSERT INTO Table2 (id, name, age, city)
SELECT id, name, age, city
FROM Table1
WHERE age > 25;
```

### Practical Examples

#### Copying All Data from One Table to Another

If you want to copy all data from `Table1` to `Table2`:

```sql
-- Insert all data from Table1 into Table2
INSERT INTO Table2 (id, name, age, city)
SELECT id, name, age, city
FROM Table1;
```

#### Copying Data with Specific Criteria

You can insert only the data that meets certain criteria:

```sql
-- Insert data from Table1 into Table2 where age is greater than 30
INSERT INTO Table2 (id, name, age, city)
SELECT id, name, age, city
FROM Table1
WHERE age > 30;
```

#### Copying Data with Column Transformation

You can transform the data while copying, such as converting to uppercase, formatting dates, or performing calculations:

```sql
-- Insert data from Table1 into Table2 with the name in uppercase
INSERT INTO Table2 (id, name, age, city)
SELECT id, UPPER(name), age, city
FROM Table1
WHERE age > 25;
```

#### Copying Data Between Different Tables with Different Columns

If `Table1` and `Table2` have different columns, you can specify only the matching columns:

```sql
-- Assume Table2 has an additional column 'country'
CREATE TABLE Table2 (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    city VARCHAR(100),
    country VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert data from Table1 into Table2, excluding the 'country' column
INSERT INTO Table2 (id, name, age, city)
SELECT id, name, age, city
FROM Table1
WHERE age > 25;
```

#### Using Subqueries to Retrieve Data

You can use subqueries to refine the data selection:

```sql
-- Insert data into Table2 for people living in cities where the average age is greater than 30
INSERT INTO Table2 (id, name, age, city)
SELECT id, name, age, city
FROM Table1
WHERE city IN (
    SELECT city
    FROM Table1
    GROUP BY city
    HAVING AVG(age) > 30
);
```

### Summary

Inserting retrieved data into a table in SQL involves using the `INSERT INTO` statement with a `SELECT` statement. This method allows you to copy data from one table to another based on specific criteria, transform the data during insertion, and handle tables with different structures. These examples demonstrate how to effectively insert retrieved data into a table across various SQL databases. If you have more specific queries or need further examples, feel free to ask! ✔️
