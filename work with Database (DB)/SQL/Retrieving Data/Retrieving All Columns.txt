\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Retrieving Data — Retrieving All Columns


Retrieving all columns from a table in SQL is straightforward using the `*` wildcard, which selects all columns in the table. Below are examples of how to retrieve all columns from a table across various SQL databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Interbase, Firebird, and Oracle.

### Example Table

Assume we have a table named `Employees` with the following structure and data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 1, 50000),
(2, 'Bob', 2, 60000),
(3, 'Charlie', 1, 55000),
(4, 'David', 3, 45000),
(5, 'Eva', 2, 70000);
```

### Retrieving All Columns

#### MySQL

```sql
-- Retrieve all columns from Employees table
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

#### PostgreSQL

```sql
-- Retrieve all columns from Employees table
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

#### SQLite

```sql
-- Retrieve all columns from Employees table
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

#### Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL)

```sql
-- Retrieve all columns from Employees table
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

#### Microsoft Access

```sql
-- Retrieve all columns from Employees table
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

#### Interbase

```sql
-- Retrieve all columns from Employees table
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

#### Firebird

```sql
-- Retrieve all columns from Employees table
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

#### Oracle

```sql
-- Retrieve all columns from Employees table
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

### Practical Scenario: Retrieving All Columns with Filtering

You can combine the retrieval of all columns with a `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on specific conditions.

#### Example: Retrieve All Columns for Employees with Salary Greater than 55000

```sql
-- MySQL
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 55000;

-- PostgreSQL
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 55000;

-- SQLite
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 55000;

-- MS SQL
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 55000;

-- Access
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 55000;

-- Interbase
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 55000;

-- Firebird
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 55000;

-- Oracle
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 55000;
```

### Summary

Retrieving all columns from a table in SQL is done using the `*` wildcard. This approach is simple and works consistently across different SQL databases. Additionally, you can combine this with filtering conditions using the `WHERE` clause to retrieve specific subsets of data.
