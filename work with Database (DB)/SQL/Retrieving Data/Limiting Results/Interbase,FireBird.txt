\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Retrieving Data — Limiting Results — Interbase,FireBird


In Interbase and Firebird, you can limit the number of rows returned by a query using the `FIRST` clause combined with the `SKIP` clause. These clauses are similar to the `LIMIT` clause found in other SQL dialects.

### Example Table

Assume we have a table named `Employees` with the following structure and data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 1, 50000),
(2, 'Bob', 2, 60000),
(3, 'Charlie', 1, 55000),
(4, 'David', 3, 45000),
(5, 'Eva', 2, 70000);
```

### Limiting Results with `FIRST` and `SKIP`

#### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT FIRST n [SKIP m] column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

- `FIRST n` limits the result to the first `n` rows.
- `SKIP m` skips the first `m` rows before starting to return rows.

#### Practical Examples

#### Retrieve the First 3 Employees

```sql
-- Retrieve the first 3 employees
SELECT FIRST 3 emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees;
```

#### Retrieve Employees with the Highest Salaries (Top N)

You can combine the `ORDER BY` clause with `FIRST` to get the top N records.

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees
SELECT FIRST 3 emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

#### Retrieve Employees Ordered by Department and Limited

```sql
-- Retrieve the first 3 employees ordered by department
SELECT FIRST 3 emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY dept_id;
```

#### Retrieve a Range of Employees (Pagination)

To retrieve a specific range of rows, you can use both `FIRST` and `SKIP`.

```sql
-- Retrieve 3 employees starting from the 2nd employee
SELECT FIRST 3 SKIP 1 emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY emp_id;
```

### Practical Scenario: Retrieving Top N Employees

Retrieve a list of the top 3 highest paid employees using the `FIRST` clause.

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees
SELECT FIRST 3 emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

### Using `FIRST` with `SKIP` for Pagination

To implement pagination, you can use both `FIRST` and `SKIP` clauses. For example, to get the second page of 3 rows each:

```sql
-- Retrieve the second set of 3 employees (page 2)
SELECT FIRST 3 SKIP 3 emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY emp_id;
```

### Summary

In Interbase and Firebird, you can limit the number of rows returned by a query using the `FIRST` clause combined with the `SKIP` clause. This is useful for retrieving a limited number of rows, such as implementing pagination or retrieving the top N records based on specific criteria. These examples demonstrate how to retrieve a limited number of rows from a table, including using ordering and pagination.
