\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Retrieving Data — Limiting Results — DB2


In IBM Db2, you can limit the number of rows returned by a query using the `FETCH FIRST` clause or the `LIMIT` clause. The `FETCH FIRST` clause is ANSI SQL compliant and is recommended for use in Db2.

### Example Table

Assume we have a table named `Employees` with the following structure and data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 1, 50000),
(2, 'Bob', 2, 60000),
(3, 'Charlie', 1, 55000),
(4, 'David', 3, 45000),
(5, 'Eva', 2, 70000);
```

### Limiting Results with `FETCH FIRST`

#### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY;
```

#### Practical Examples

#### Retrieve the First 3 Employees

```sql
-- Retrieve the first 3 employees
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
```

#### Retrieve Employees with the Highest Salaries (Top N)

You can combine the `ORDER BY` clause with `FETCH FIRST` to get the top N records.

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
```

#### Retrieve Employees Ordered by Department and Limited

```sql
-- Retrieve the first 3 employees ordered by department
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY dept_id
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
```

### Using `LIMIT` Clause

While the `FETCH FIRST` clause is recommended and more portable across different SQL databases, Db2 also supports the `LIMIT` clause for compatibility with other SQL dialects.

#### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT n;
```

#### Practical Examples

#### Retrieve the First 3 Employees Using `LIMIT`

```sql
-- Retrieve the first 3 employees using LIMIT
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
LIMIT 3;
```

#### Retrieve Employees with the Highest Salaries Using `LIMIT`

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees using LIMIT
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### Practical Scenario: Retrieving Top N Employees

Retrieve a list of the top 3 highest paid employees using both `FETCH FIRST` and `LIMIT` clauses for demonstration.

#### Using `FETCH FIRST`

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees using FETCH FIRST
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
```

#### Using `LIMIT`

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees using LIMIT
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### Summary

In Db2, you can limit the number of rows returned by a query using the `FETCH FIRST` clause or the `LIMIT` clause. The `FETCH FIRST` clause is ANSI SQL compliant and is recommended for use in Db2. These examples demonstrate how to retrieve a limited number of rows from a table, including using ordering to get the top N records.
