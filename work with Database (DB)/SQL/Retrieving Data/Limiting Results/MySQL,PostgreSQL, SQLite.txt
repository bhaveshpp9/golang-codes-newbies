\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Retrieving Data — Limiting Results — MySQL,PostgreSQL, SQLite


In MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, you can limit the number of rows returned by a query using the `LIMIT` clause. Additionally, PostgreSQL and MySQL also support the `OFFSET` clause for pagination. Here’s how you can retrieve and limit results in these databases.

### MySQL

#### Using the `LIMIT` Clause

The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned.

##### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT n;
```

##### Practical Examples

**Retrieve the First 3 Employees**

```sql
-- Retrieve the first 3 employees
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
LIMIT 3;
```

**Retrieve Employees with the Highest Salaries (Top N)**

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### Using the `LIMIT` Clause with `OFFSET` for Pagination

The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses are useful for implementing pagination.

##### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT n OFFSET m;
```

##### Practical Examples

**Retrieve Employees Ordered by Salary, with Pagination**

```sql
-- Retrieve the second page of 3 employees, ordered by salary
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;
```

### PostgreSQL

#### Using the `LIMIT` Clause

The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned.

##### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT n;
```

##### Practical Examples

**Retrieve the First 3 Employees**

```sql
-- Retrieve the first 3 employees
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
LIMIT 3;
```

**Retrieve Employees with the Highest Salaries (Top N)**

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### Using the `LIMIT` Clause with `OFFSET` for Pagination

The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses are useful for implementing pagination.

##### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT n OFFSET m;
```

##### Practical Examples

**Retrieve Employees Ordered by Salary, with Pagination**

```sql
-- Retrieve the second page of 3 employees, ordered by salary
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;
```

### SQLite

#### Using the `LIMIT` Clause

The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned.

##### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT n;
```

##### Practical Examples

**Retrieve the First 3 Employees**

```sql
-- Retrieve the first 3 employees
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
LIMIT 3;
```

**Retrieve Employees with the Highest Salaries (Top N)**

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### Using the `LIMIT` Clause with `OFFSET` for Pagination

The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses are useful for implementing pagination.

##### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT n OFFSET m;
```

##### Practical Examples

**Retrieve Employees Ordered by Salary, with Pagination**

```sql
-- Retrieve the second page of 3 employees, ordered by salary
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;
```

### Practical Scenario: Retrieving Top N Employees

#### MySQL Example

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees using LIMIT in MySQL
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### PostgreSQL Example

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees using LIMIT in PostgreSQL
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### SQLite Example

```sql
-- Retrieve the top 3 highest paid employees using LIMIT in SQLite
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### Summary

In MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, you can limit the number of rows returned by a query using the `LIMIT` clause. For pagination, you can combine the `LIMIT` clause with the `OFFSET` clause. These examples demonstrate how to retrieve a limited number of rows from a table in these databases.
