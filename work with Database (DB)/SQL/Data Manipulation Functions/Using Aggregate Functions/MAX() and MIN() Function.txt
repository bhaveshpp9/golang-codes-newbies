\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Data Manipulation Functions — Using Aggregate Functions — MAX() and MIN() Function

The `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions in SQL are used to find the maximum and minimum values in a set of values, respectively. These functions are useful for identifying the highest and lowest values in a dataset, such as the maximum salary in a company or the minimum age in a group of people. Here’s how to use the `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions across various SQL databases.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

### Examples in Different SQL Databases

#### MySQL

1. **Finding the maximum value:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary
   FROM Employees;
   ```

2. **Finding the minimum value:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary
   FROM Employees;
   ```

3. **Finding the maximum and minimum values grouped by a column:**
   ```sql
   SELECT Department, 
          MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary, 
          MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY Department;
   ```

#### SQL Server

1. **Finding the maximum value:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary
   FROM Employees;
   ```

2. **Finding the minimum value:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary
   FROM Employees;
   ```

3. **Finding the maximum and minimum values grouped by a column:**
   ```sql
   SELECT Department, 
          MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary, 
          MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY Department;
   ```

#### PostgreSQL

1. **Finding the maximum value:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary
   FROM Employees;
   ```

2. **Finding the minimum value:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary
   FROM Employees;
   ```

3. **Finding the maximum and minimum values grouped by a column:**
   ```sql
   SELECT Department, 
          MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary, 
          MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY Department;
   ```

#### SQLite

1. **Finding the maximum value:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary
   FROM Employees;
   ```

2. **Finding the minimum value:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary
   FROM Employees;
   ```

3. **Finding the maximum and minimum values grouped by a column:**
   ```sql
   SELECT Department, 
          MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary, 
          MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY Department;
   ```

### Practical Examples and Use Cases

#### Finding Maximum and Minimum Dates

You can use `MAX()` and `MIN()` to find the latest and earliest dates in a table.

##### MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite

```sql
SELECT MAX(OrderDate) AS LatestOrder, MIN(OrderDate) AS EarliestOrder
FROM Orders;
```

#### Finding Maximum and Minimum Prices

##### MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite

```sql
SELECT MAX(Price) AS HighestPrice, MIN(Price) AS LowestPrice
FROM Products;
```

#### Combining with Other Aggregate Functions

You can combine `MAX()` and `MIN()` with other aggregate functions for a comprehensive analysis.

##### MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite

```sql
SELECT Department,
       MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary,
       MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary,
       AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary,
       SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

### Handling NULL Values

The `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions ignore `NULL` values. If you want to consider `NULL` values as zero, you can use the `COALESCE` function.

##### Example Handling NULL Values in Salary Analysis

##### MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite

```sql
SELECT Department,
       MAX(COALESCE(Salary, 0)) AS MaxSalary,
       MIN(COALESCE(Salary, 0)) AS MinSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

### Using MAX() and MIN() in Subqueries

You can use `MAX()` and `MIN()` in subqueries to find records that have the maximum or minimum values.

##### Example: Finding Employee with Highest Salary

##### MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

##### Example: Finding Employee with Lowest Salary

##### MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary = (SELECT MIN(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

### Summary

The `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions are essential tools in SQL for finding the highest and lowest values in a dataset. They can be used in various scenarios, such as finding maximum and minimum salaries, dates, or prices. These functions can be combined with other aggregate functions, used with `GROUP BY` for grouped calculations, and incorporated into subqueries for more complex queries. The syntax is consistent across different SQL databases, making it easy to apply these techniques regardless of the SQL dialect you are using.

These examples demonstrate how to effectively use the `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions to gain insights from your data. If you have more specific queries or need further examples, feel free to ask! ✔️
