\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Updating Tables — renaming tables — SQLite


Renaming tables in SQLite is straightforward using the `ALTER TABLE` statement with the `RENAME TO` clause. This allows you to change the name of an existing table easily.

### Syntax

```sql
ALTER TABLE old_table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;
```

### Example

Assume you have a table named `Employees` that you want to rename to `Staff`.

```sql
-- Rename the Employees table to Staff
ALTER TABLE Employees RENAME TO Staff;
```

### Practical Example: Renaming a Table

Here is a practical example of renaming a table from `Employees` to `Staff` in SQLite.

#### Step-by-Step Example

1. **Create the `Employees` Table** (if it doesn't already exist):

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name TEXT,
    dept_id INTEGER,
    salary INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO Employees (emp_name, dept_id, salary) VALUES
('Alice', 1, 50000),
('Bob', 2, 60000),
('Charlie', 1, 55000),
('David', 3, 45000),
('Eva', 2, 70000);
```

2. **Rename the `Employees` Table to `Staff`**:

```sql
-- Rename the Employees table to Staff
ALTER TABLE Employees RENAME TO Staff;
```

### Considerations

1. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to rename tables.
2. **Dependencies**: Be aware of any dependencies such as foreign keys or views that reference the old table name. These dependencies need to be updated to reflect the new table name.

### Handling Dependencies

If your table has dependencies like views, you need to update them accordingly. SQLite does not automatically update the names in dependent objects.

#### Example: Updating a View

Assume you have a view that references the `Employees` table:

```sql
CREATE VIEW EmpView AS
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
FROM Employees;
```

After renaming the table to `Staff`, you need to recreate the view:

```sql
-- Drop the old view
DROP VIEW EmpView;

-- Create the view again with the new table name
CREATE VIEW EmpView AS
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
FROM Staff;
```

### Renaming Multiple Tables

SQLite does not support renaming multiple tables in a single `ALTER TABLE` statement, so you must rename each table individually.

#### Example

Assume you have two tables, `Employees` and `Departments`, that you want to rename to `Staff` and `Divisions`, respectively.

```sql
-- Rename the Employees table to Staff
ALTER TABLE Employees RENAME TO Staff;

-- Rename the Departments table to Divisions
ALTER TABLE Departments RENAME TO Divisions;
```

### Summary

Renaming tables in SQLite is done using the `ALTER TABLE` statement with the `RENAME TO` clause. This approach is straightforward and requires updating any dependencies manually. The provided examples demonstrate how to rename a table effectively in SQLite.
