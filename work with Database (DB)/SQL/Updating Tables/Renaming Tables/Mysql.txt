\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Updating Tables — renaming tables — Mysql


Renaming tables in MySQL is straightforward using the `RENAME TABLE` statement. This command allows you to rename one or more tables in a single statement. Below are examples of how to rename a table in MySQL.

### Using `RENAME TABLE`

The `RENAME TABLE` statement is used to change the name of an existing table.

#### Syntax

```sql
RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;
```

#### Example

Assume you have a table named `Employees` that you want to rename to `Staff`.

```sql
-- Rename the Employees table to Staff
RENAME TABLE Employees TO Staff;
```

### Practical Example: Renaming a Table

Here is a practical example of renaming a table from `Employees` to `Staff` in MySQL.

#### Step-by-Step Example

1. **Create the `Employees` Table** (if it doesn't already exist):

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 1, 50000),
(2, 'Bob', 2, 60000),
(3, 'Charlie', 1, 55000),
(4, 'David', 3, 45000),
(5, 'Eva', 2, 70000);
```

2. **Rename the `Employees` Table to `Staff`**:

```sql
-- Rename the Employees table to Staff
RENAME TABLE Employees TO Staff;
```

### Renaming Multiple Tables

You can also rename multiple tables in a single statement by separating each rename operation with a comma.

#### Example

Assume you have two tables, `Employees` and `Departments`, that you want to rename to `Staff` and `Divisions`, respectively.

```sql
-- Rename multiple tables in one statement
RENAME TABLE Employees TO Staff, Departments TO Divisions;
```

### Considerations

1. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to rename tables.
2. **Dependencies**: Be aware of any dependencies such as foreign keys, views, or stored procedures that reference the old table name. These dependencies need to be updated to reflect the new table name.
3. **Atomicity**: The `RENAME TABLE` statement is atomic, meaning that if one rename operation fails, none of the changes will be applied.

### Summary

Renaming tables in MySQL is done using the `RENAME TABLE` statement. This command allows you to rename one or more tables in a single statement. The provided examples demonstrate how to rename a table effectively in MySQL, as well as how to handle multiple table renames.
