\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Updating Tables — renaming tables — Ms SQL Server


Renaming tables in Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL Server) is typically done using the `sp_rename` stored procedure. Unlike some other SQL databases, SQL Server does not support the `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO` syntax for renaming tables directly. Below are the steps and examples to rename a table in MS SQL Server.

### Using `sp_rename` Stored Procedure

The `sp_rename` stored procedure allows you to rename a table or other database objects such as columns or indexes.

#### Syntax

```sql
EXEC sp_rename 'old_table_name', 'new_table_name';
```

#### Example

Assume you have a table named `Employees` that you want to rename to `Staff`.

```sql
-- Rename the Employees table to Staff
EXEC sp_rename 'Employees', 'Staff';
```

### Practical Example: Renaming a Table

Here is a practical example of renaming a table from `Employees` to `Staff` in MS SQL Server.

#### Step-by-Step Example

1. **Create the `Employees` Table** (if it doesn't already exist):

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 1, 50000),
(2, 'Bob', 2, 60000),
(3, 'Charlie', 1, 55000),
(4, 'David', 3, 45000),
(5, 'Eva', 2, 70000);
```

2. **Rename the `Employees` Table to `Staff`**:

```sql
-- Rename the Employees table to Staff
EXEC sp_rename 'Employees', 'Staff';
```

### Considerations

1. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to rename tables.
2. **Dependencies**: Be aware of any dependencies such as foreign keys, views, or stored procedures that reference the old table name. These dependencies may need to be updated to reflect the new table name.
3. **Schema**: If the table is within a specific schema, you need to include the schema name in the `sp_rename` procedure.

#### Example with Schema

If your table is within a schema named `dbo`:

```sql
-- Rename the Employees table to Staff within the dbo schema
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Employees', 'Staff';
```

### Summary

Renaming tables in MS SQL Server is accomplished using the `sp_rename` stored procedure. This approach is different from other SQL databases that might use `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO`. The provided examples demonstrate how to rename a table in MS SQL Server effectively.
