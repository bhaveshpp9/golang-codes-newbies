\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Updating Tables — Deleting foreign key — MySql


To delete a foreign key constraint in MySQL, you need to use the `ALTER TABLE` statement combined with the `DROP FOREIGN KEY` clause. Here’s how you can delete a foreign key constraint in MySQL.

### Example Table

Assume we have the following tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_dept FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)
);
```

### Steps to Delete a Foreign Key Constraint

1. **Identify the Foreign Key Constraint Name**: The constraint name is needed to drop it. If you don’t know the name, you can find it by querying the information schema.

2. **Drop the Foreign Key Constraint**: Use the `ALTER TABLE` statement to drop the constraint.

#### Step 1: Identify the Foreign Key Constraint Name

If you don’t know the foreign key constraint name, you can find it by querying the `information_schema`:

```sql
SELECT CONSTRAINT_NAME
FROM information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'Employees'
AND CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA = 'your_database_name'
AND REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = 'Departments';
```

Replace `your_database_name` with the name of your database.

#### Step 2: Drop the Foreign Key Constraint

Once you have the foreign key constraint name, you can drop it using the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

#### Syntax

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP FOREIGN KEY foreign_key_name;
```

#### Example

Assume the foreign key constraint is named `fk_dept`. To delete the foreign key constraint:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_dept;
```

### Practical Example: Deleting a Foreign Key Constraint

Assume we have the following setup for the tables and the foreign key constraint name is `fk_dept`.

#### Table Definitions

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_dept FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)
);
```

#### Deleting the Foreign Key Constraint

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_dept;
```

### Finding and Deleting a Foreign Key Constraint

If you don't know the constraint name, find it first:

```sql
-- Find the foreign key constraint name
SELECT CONSTRAINT_NAME
FROM information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'Employees'
AND CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA = 'your_database_name'
AND REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = 'Departments';
```

Replace `your_database_name` with the actual name of your database.

Once you have the foreign key constraint name, delete it:

```sql
-- Drop the foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_dept;
```

### Summary

Deleting a foreign key constraint in MySQL involves using the `ALTER TABLE` statement combined with the `DROP FOREIGN KEY` clause. You need to know the foreign key constraint name to drop it. If the constraint name is not known, you can query the `information_schema` to find it. The provided examples demonstrate how to delete a foreign key constraint effectively.
