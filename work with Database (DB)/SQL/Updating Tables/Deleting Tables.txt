\\ work with database(DB) — SQL — Updating Tables — Deleting Tables


Deleting a table from a database in SQL is done using the `DROP TABLE` statement. This command removes the table definition and all its data, freeing the storage space occupied by the table. Below are examples of how to delete a table in various SQL databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle.

### General Syntax

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

### Example Table

Assume we have the following table named `Employees` that we want to delete:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT,
    salary INT
);
```

### MySQL

In MySQL, you use the `DROP TABLE` statement to delete a table.

#### Example

```sql
-- Delete the Employees table in MySQL
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

### PostgreSQL

In PostgreSQL, you use the `DROP TABLE` statement to delete a table.

#### Example

```sql
-- Delete the Employees table in PostgreSQL
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

### SQLite

In SQLite, you use the `DROP TABLE` statement to delete a table.

#### Example

```sql
-- Delete the Employees table in SQLite
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

### Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL)

In MS SQL Server, you use the `DROP TABLE` statement to delete a table.

#### Example

```sql
-- Delete the Employees table in MS SQL Server
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

### Oracle

In Oracle, you use the `DROP TABLE` statement to delete a table.

#### Example

```sql
-- Delete the Employees table in Oracle
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

### Practical Example: Deleting a Table

Here is a practical example of deleting the `Employees` table across various SQL databases.

#### MySQL Example

```sql
-- Delete the Employees table in MySQL
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

#### PostgreSQL Example

```sql
-- Delete the Employees table in PostgreSQL
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

#### SQLite Example

```sql
-- Delete the Employees table in SQLite
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

#### MS SQL Server Example

```sql
-- Delete the Employees table in MS SQL Server
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

#### Oracle Example

```sql
-- Delete the Employees table in Oracle
DROP TABLE Employees;
```

### Considerations

1. **Data Loss**: Dropping a table deletes all data within the table permanently. Ensure that you have backups or that you no longer need the data before performing this operation.
2. **Dependencies**: Dropping a table can affect other database objects like foreign keys, views, and stored procedures that reference the table. Ensure that these dependencies are handled appropriately.
3. **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to drop the table.

### Summary

Deleting a table in SQL is performed using the `DROP TABLE` statement, which is supported by all major SQL databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle. This command removes the table definition and all its data. The provided examples demonstrate how to delete a table effectively across various SQL databases.
