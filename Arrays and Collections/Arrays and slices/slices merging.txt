\\ Arrays and collections —  Arrays and Slices — slices merging


Merging slices in Go is a straightforward operation that can be performed using the built-in `append` function. This function is versatile and can handle appending multiple slices together into a single slice. The `append` function not only adds elements to the end of a slice but can also combine two or more slices.

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to merge multiple slices into one:

### Example: Merging Slices in Go

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// Define two slices of integers
	firstSlice := []int{1, 2, 3}
	secondSlice := []int{4, 5, 6}
	thirdSlice := []int{7, 8, 9}

	// Merge the slices
	mergedSlice := append(firstSlice, secondSlice...)
	mergedSlice = append(mergedSlice, thirdSlice...)

	// Print the merged slice
	fmt.Println("Merged Slice:", mergedSlice)
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`append` Function**: The `append` function is used to add elements from one slice to another. The `...` operator is used to expand the second slice, allowing its elements to be appended individually to the first slice.
- **Merging Multiple Slices**: You can repeatedly use `append` to add more slices. In the example, `secondSlice` is appended to `firstSlice`, and then `thirdSlice` is appended to the result.

This method is highly efficient and leverages Go's capability to handle slice capacities dynamically. When using `append`, if the underlying array of the slice does not have enough capacity to accommodate the new elements, a new array will be allocated. The original elements will be copied to this new array along with the new elements.

### Additional Usage Tip:
You can also use a single `append` call to concatenate multiple slices if you prepare the arguments appropriately:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// Define slices
	firstSlice := []int{1, 2, 3}
	secondSlice := []int{4, 5, 6}
	thirdSlice := []int{7, 8, 9}

	// Merge all slices in one line
	mergedSlice := append(append(firstSlice, secondSlice...), thirdSlice...)

	// Print the merged slice
	fmt.Println("Merged Slice:", mergedSlice)
}
```

Both methods are valid, but the single line merge can be more succinct and easier to read for shorter lists of slices. However, if clarity or performance considerations dictate, using multiple append operations as in the first example may be preferred. This approach avoids creating intermediate slices and may offer performance benefits in scenarios where many slices are being merged in a complex application.
