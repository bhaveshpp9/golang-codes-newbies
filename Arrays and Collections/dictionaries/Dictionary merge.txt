\\ Arrays and collections —  Dictionaries — Dictionary merge


Merging dictionaries, or maps as they're called in Go, is a straightforward process that involves iterating over one map and inserting its key-value pairs into another. This can be useful when you want to combine data from two sources, update settings, or simply aggregate information.

Here’s a simple example to illustrate how to merge two dictionaries in Go:

### Example: Merging Two Maps

This example demonstrates merging two maps where both maps have string keys and integer values. The approach ensures that if there are overlapping keys, the values from the second map will overwrite those from the first.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    // First map
    map1 := map[string]int{
        "apple":  1,
        "banana": 2,
        "cherry": 3,
    }

    // Second map
    map2 := map[string]int{
        "banana": 22,
        "durian": 4,
        "elderberry": 5,
    }

    // Merge map2 into map1
    for key, value := range map2 {
        map1[key] = value
    }

    // Print the merged map
    fmt.Println("Merged map:", map1)
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Maps Initialization**: Two maps are initialized with string keys and integer values.
- **Merging Process**: The `for` loop iterates over each key-value pair in `map2`. Each pair is inserted into `map1` using the assignment `map1[key] = value`. If `map1` already contains the key, its value will be updated; otherwise, the key-value pair is added.
- **Result**: `map1` now contains all key-value pairs from both `map1` and `map2`, with `map2` values taking precedence in case of key conflicts.

### Handling More Complex Data

If the maps contain more complex data structures, such as slices or structs, and you need to merge or combine this data rather than overwrite it, you would need a more sophisticated merging logic. Here’s an example where each key points to a slice of integers:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    // First map with slices of integers
    map1 := map[string][]int{
        "apple":  {1, 2},
        "banana": {3, 4},
    }

    // Second map with slices of integers
    map2 := map[string][]int{
        "banana": {22},
        "cherry": {5, 6},
    }

    // Merge map2 into map1, combining slices where keys overlap
    for key, value := range map2 {
        if existingValues, exists := map1[key]; exists {
            // Combine the slices
            map1[key] = append(existingValues, value...)
        } else {
            // Just add the new key-value pair
            map1[key] = value
        }
    }

    // Print the merged map
    fmt.Println("Merged map with slices:", map1)
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Complex Maps**: Both `map1` and `map2` contain slices as values.
- **Merging Logic**: When merging, the function checks if the key already exists in `map1`. If it does, it appends `map2`'s slice to `map1`'s existing slice. If not, it simply adds the new key-value pair.
- **Flexible Handling**: This approach allows for more flexibility in managing how data structures are combined, essential for complex applications.
