\\ Arrays and collections — Sets — treeset


In Go, there is no built-in TreeSet implementation like there is in some other languages such as Java. A `TreeSet` is typically a set that is backed by a tree structure, often a Red-Black tree, which keeps its elements sorted according to their natural ordering or a specified comparator. To implement a TreeSet in Go, you'd need to use an external library or implement your own mechanism to keep elements ordered.

One common approach in Go for ordered collections is to use a combination of a slice to maintain order and a map to manage uniqueness and allow for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions. For a more robust and tree-based implementation, you might consider using a third-party package like `github.com/emirpasic/gods` which provides various data structures including trees.

Here's an example of how you might simulate a TreeSet in Go using a slice for ordering and a map for fast access, though it's not backed by a tree and does not have the same performance characteristics:

### Basic TreeSet Implementation Using a Slice and a Map

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sort"
)

// TreeSet struct simulates a TreeSet using a slice and a map
type TreeSet struct {
    elementsMap map[int]struct{}
    elementsSlice []int
}

// NewTreeSet creates a new TreeSet
func NewTreeSet() *TreeSet {
    return &TreeSet{
        elementsMap: make(map[int]struct{}),
        elementsSlice: []int{},
    }
}

// Add inserts a new element if it isn't already present
func (ts *TreeSet) Add(element int) bool {
    if _, exists := ts.elementsMap[element]; !exists {
        ts.elementsMap[element] = struct{}{}
        ts.elementsSlice = append(ts.elementsSlice, element)
        sort.Ints(ts.elementsSlice) // Keep the slice sorted
        return true
    }
    return false
}

// Remove deletes an element if it exists
func (ts *TreeSet) Remove(element int) bool {
    if _, exists := ts.elementsMap[element]; exists {
        delete(ts.elementsMap, element)
        index := sort.SearchInts(ts.elementsSlice, element)
        ts.elementsSlice = append(ts.elementsSlice[:index], ts.elementsSlice[index+1:]...)
        return true
    }
    return false
}

// Contains checks if an element exists in the TreeSet
func (ts *TreeSet) Contains(element int) bool {
    _, exists := ts.elementsMap[element]
    return exists
}

func main() {
    ts := NewTreeSet()
    ts.Add(10)
    ts.Add(5)
    ts.Add(20)
    ts.Remove(5)
    ts.Add(5)

    fmt.Println("TreeSet Elements:", ts.elementsSlice)
}

```

### Explanation:
- **TreeSet Structure**: Combines a map for uniqueness and fast lookup and a slice to maintain order.
- **Add and Remove**: When adding or removing elements, both the map and slice are updated to ensure the set remains ordered and consistent.
- **Performance Considerations**: Using `sort.Ints()` during each addition ensures elements are sorted but isn't as efficient as a tree-based implementation which maintains order with lower overhead for insertions and deletions.

For actual tree-based set implementations in Go that maintain order with more efficiency than sorting a slice every time you add an element, consider using a specialized library like [GoDS (Go Data Structures)](https://github.com/emirpasic/gods). Libraries like GoDS offer Red-Black tree implementations and other complex data structures that can be used directly to create a TreeSet-like behavior.
