\\ Arrays and collections — Sets — Search for a element


In Go, since sets are usually implemented using maps with keys representing the elements and an empty struct as the value, searching for an element is direct and efficient. The key feature of a map is that it provides O(1) average-time complexity for lookups, which makes it excellent for set operations where frequent checks for element existence are required.

Here’s a simple example of how to implement a set and search for an element within that set:

### Example: Searching for an Element in a Set

We will use a map to create a basic set and define functions to add elements and check for their existence.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

// Set type defined using a map to emulate set behavior
type Set map[string]struct{}

// NewSet creates a new set
func NewSet() Set {
    return make(Set)
}

// Add adds an element to the set
func (s Set) Add(element string) {
    s[element] = struct{}{}
}

// Contains checks if an element is in the set
func (s Set) Contains(element string) bool {
    _, exists := s[element]
    return exists
}

func main() {
    // Initialize the set
    set := NewSet()

    // Add some elements
    set.Add("apple")
    set.Add("banana")
    set.Add("cherry")

    // Search for elements
    search := "banana"
    if set.Contains(search) {
        fmt.Printf("The set contains '%s'.\n", search)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("The set does not contain '%s'.\n", search)
    }

    // Search for an element not in the set
    search = "mango"
    if set.Contains(search) {
        fmt.Printf("The set contains '%s'.\n", search)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("The set does not contain '%s'.\n", search)
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Set Type**: Defined as a `map[string]struct{}` to simulate a set. The `struct{}` is used as the value type because it doesn't allocate space, making it efficient.
- **NewSet Function**: Initializes a new empty set.
- **Add Method**: Adds a new element to the set. Since map keys in Go are unique, adding an already existing element has no effect, which mirrors set behavior.
- **Contains Method**: Checks if a given element exists in the set. It utilizes the map's ability to return two values on lookup: the value and a boolean indicating if the key exists.
- **Main Function**: Demonstrates adding elements and checking for their presence using the `Contains` method.

This example provides a clear and efficient way to manage and search for elements in a set using Go's built-in map type. This method is particularly useful for operations that require frequent membership checks, ensuring optimal performance with constant time complexity.
